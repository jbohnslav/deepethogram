  # how to fuse the outputs of the spatial model and flow model. Default: averaging them together. Other option:
  # concatenate. This concatenates the two vectors, followed by a fully connected layer with outputs of shape (K),
  # aka number of behaviors.
  fusion: average
  # deprecated: used to over-sample rare classes
  sampler: null
  # use batchnorm in the final layer, just before sigmoid / softmax
  final_bn: false
  # deprecated: how much to over-sample
  sampling_ratio: null
  # The activation function on the final layer. options include sigmoid, softmax. Use softmax for mutually-exclusive
  # behaviors. Note: models have not been trained with this in mind.
  final_activation: sigmoid
  # the amount of dropout on the 512-d feature vector before the last fully connected layer. 0.9 is already very high.
  # if your model is under-fitting (highly unlikely), reduce this value.

  n_flows: 10
  # how many RGB frames to use as inputs to the spatial CNN
  n_rgb: 1
  # if true, trains feature extractors in a curriculum. first trains the spatial CNN, then the flow CNN, and finally
  # the two jointly end-to-end. If false, will be end-to-end from the start: faster, but with potentially lower
  # performance.
  curriculum: false

  inputs: both
  # the amount of weight decay (L2 normalization) to use on the feature extractors.
  weight_decay: 0 # use 1e-4 if training from scratch
  # path to a checkpoint.pt file which will reload this model. Should have weights for both spatial and flow streams
