  # options: null, min_bout
  # null: the postprocessor will simply threshold, and then compute the background
  # min_bout: the postprocessor will threshold, remove sets of 1s or 0s of length less than
  #           postprocessor.min_bout_length, and then will compute background
  type: min_bout
  # if type is min_bout, postprocessor will remove any consecutive set of 1s or 0s of less than this length.
